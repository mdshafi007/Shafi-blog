        <h1>Homework Writing Ai Machine ‚ö°Ô∏èüî•</h1>
        <p>Ai can now write your home work, assignments and projects...especially in your handwriting. Both looks same right?
            This Ai machine named Home Work Machine, was developed by a Kerala-based engineering student named Devadath. This homework machine writes anything for you in very less time.This machine has one app built in with chat gpt. You just need to type the question.... and the machine will write the answer on a book or paper. Well, you can also choose your own documents.
            The programming language used to make this machine work is‚Ä¶. Python.This machine costed 20,000 rupees to build, and it is still developing. We will be able to buy this machine in upcoming days. But one thing that strikes me is: what if this machine can sign anyone's signature on any document? 
            Yeah, this is something which is so concerning.</p>
