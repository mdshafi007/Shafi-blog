        <h1>Don't buy tws ear buds before knowing this!</h1>
        <p>1. Audio Drivers: Sound devices contain audio drivers, which gives us sound.  To get a good sound experience, your earbuds must have at least 10mm or more than 10mm audio drivers.</p>
        <p>2. Connectivity: If you want a good connection between your earbuds and mobile, then make sure it has at least a Bluetooth version of 5.0 or more than 5.0. This will make your earbuds connect with any device fast and increase the wireless range.</p>
        <p>3. Battery: Battery is very important. Every earbuds must have at least 20hrs of battery life and if you want a greater battery life, check for more than 20hours.</p>
        <p>4. Comfort: there are 2 types of earbuds. Half in ear... Full in ear. Now this depends on the work you do on your daily basis. So you have to look carefully on which type of earbuds suits for you.</p>
