        <h1>How to Record a Zoom Meeting</h1>
        <p>So friends, to record a Zoom meeting on your computer or laptop, you need to download a screen recording software called 'Free Cam 8'. This is the best free screen recording software that I've found, and I'll put the download link in the description. After downloading, install it normally and click on Launch to open the simple interface of the software.</p>
        <p>Next, click on 'New Recording' and select the size you want to capture. I recommend selecting full screen. Now, go to Settings and make sure the audio recording box is ticked; otherwise, only the video will be recorded without any sound. Once everything is set up, open your Zoom software, connect to a meeting, and click the red circle to start recording.</p>
        <p>After the meeting ends, press F9 to stop the recording. You can review your recording, and to save it, click on 'Save as Video', choose the location, rename it, and click Save. Your recording is now successfully saved and ready to watch again and again. So friends, this is how you can easily record a Zoom meeting with audio on any computer or laptop.</p>
